Can you make the smrtest moves?

In a faraway and mythical foreign land, a critical part of the subway has been disabled by floodwaters filling the train tunnel! However, the drainage system is out of order due to multiple misalignments of the main pipe. Players need to rotate the pipe segments to get the correct configuration and allow the water to flow from one end to the other and drain the tunnel before it is fully flooded and the poor passengers are drowned, much like how SUTD students are drowned in schoolwork.

A 5x5 grid made up of hexagonal tiles is given to the player, each tile containing a scrambled segment of the pipe. Each tile may have 8 different shapes. The player has to rotate the segments of the pipe systematically until they are all connected, draining the tunnel.

Achieving players might even be rewarded with something special.
